# Chiselled Ubuntu

- Or **rocks**. Built using **rockcraft**
- ubuntu/jre by Canonical does not have bash, a package manager, or OpenJDK. Its purpose is to serve as a runtime.
- Basically .NET and JRE
- But very manual and error-prone since you have to define **slices** like `/usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf`
