# Zero Trust

- Zero trust is about insider attacks and sabotage.
- Small companies have to assume everybody working for them is good and leave a lot of doors unlocked. Because "If you can't trust your engineers then what are they doing there?". Otherwise **you're not going to make it**.
- But if you have thousands of employees, there's a good chance a single digit number of them are nation state actors. Passing an interview is easier than trying to hack into it.
- It made it a lot more difficult to develop software if you can't hop on prod. That's where platform teams come in, to allow teams to stay efficient.
