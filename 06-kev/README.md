# CISA KEV Catalog

- **Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)** is a **catalog** maintained by CISA that documents which CVEs have **known exploits**. KEV will be discussed in the next lesson.
- They can get **cool names** and federal agencies must remediate vulnerabilities in this catalog by a due date specified by CISA
- Heartbleed (2014) was a compromise when OpenSSL allowed an attacker to read the memory of a system without detection.
- Shellshock (2014) went unnoticed for 25 years, existing in Bash since 1989. Botnets were deployed against high-profile entities like the US Department of Defense.
- Log4Shell (2021) was a compromise when a popular Java logging util with remote code execution. An Alibana security researcher privately notified Apache. Something leaked and Cloudflare confirmed they observed real-world exploitation attempts a week later.
